# ElevatorSimulator

This is a program that simulates elevators in a multi-story building.
This is a .Net 7 project and in order to run it, one needs to install the .net 7 SDK or the .net 7 runtime.
To run it locally, clone the repo and run the donet restore and dotnet run commands on project ElevatorSimulatorMain.

## The following assumptions were used when writing this program:
#### -The building has a maximum of 10 floors
#### -The building has a maximum of 4 elevators.
#### -The elevators are identical, and each elevator has a maximum carrying capacity of 8 passengers
#### -The movement upwards is represnted by 1
#### -The movement downwards is represented by -1
